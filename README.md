Evaluating the purity of both the human and mouse cardiomyocytes and calculating the entropy are in our Final_project_Q124_final_version1.ipynb notebook. (Part 1,2, and corresponding parts of 4)

For cellOracle, we have two notebooks. Eval_wuData.ipynb is where we use celloracle's GRN to simulate a gene knockout and compare the simulated result to the experimental result, and Q3_mouseData.ipynb is where we train a model on reference data, perform a knockout 3 genes, then compare the simulated performance to our cardiomyocytes to evaluate how the perturbation affects maturation. (Part 3) 

The order these are run in doesn't affect the outcome, but we recommend Final_project_Q124_final_version1.ipynb, then Eval_wuData.ipynb, then Q3_mouseData.ipynb.
